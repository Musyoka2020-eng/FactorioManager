Quick Installation:

2. Run FactorioModManagerSetup-1.1.0.exe
3. Follow the installer prompts
4. The installer will:
   - Detect the old v1.0.0 version
   - Automatically uninstall it (you'll see a progress screen)
   - Install the new v1.1.0 version
   - Optionally launch the app when done
5. Verify installation - check title bar shows "v1.1.0"

Installation Files:

3. Restart your computer
4. Run FactorioModManagerSetup-1.1.0.exe

Troubleshooting:
If the app still shows v1.0.0 after upgrade:
- This indicates old files are cached
- Solution: Restart your computer completely and run the installer again
- The auto-upgrade feature will detect and remove the old version properly

If Download tab is still empty:
- The install was successful but app needs restart
- Close the app completely
- Run it again fresh - all tabs should now display content
